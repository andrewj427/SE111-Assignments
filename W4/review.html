        <h2>Review</h2>
        <p><b>Andrew Johnston</b>,<i>4/20/2025</i></p>
        <p><em>Star Wars Episode III</em> is one of my favorite movies of all time. I grew up watching these movies, with this one being my favorite. I love the twists, like how everyone started to figure out that Chancellor Palpatine is a sith lord, and the order 66 scene. I also like how throughout the movie, you can see Anakin's distrust in the Jedi grow stronger, and see him giving in to the sith more and more. The music is another reason why I like this movie. it adds a lot of emotion into the movie. The battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin is my favorite scene of the movie, and the <i>battle of the heroes</i> track in the background makes it that much better.</p>

            <h3>Trivia</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ian McDarmid, who plays Palpatine in the movie, did all of his own lightsaber stunts</li>
                <li>The movie was shot under the working title “The Bridge” to avoid leaks. The name symbolized how this episode connects the prequels with the original trilogy.</li>
                <li>George Lucas deliberately made Episode III the darkest of the prequels, showing Anakin’s full descent into Darth Vader. It's the only Star Wars film to be rated PG-13 before Disney took over.</li>
